Many can only be detected by sequencing, such as from myriad genetics. However, a dozens of extra possible mutations of interest can be reached with imputation analysis. The following lists your genotype for the directly measured three 23andme-SNPs as well as all other imputed SNPs in the two genes that are either missense or nonsense. For interpretation we recommend reading more about <u><a href='http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/'>polyphen</a></u>, <u><a href='http://sift.jcvi.org/'>sift-scores</a></u> and <u><a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/intro/'>clinvar</a></u>.<br><br>
