	     Autoimmune diseases is a broad category of diseases ranging from diseaes of the joints, to the guts to the skin. However, the common characteristic of all of them is that they are problems of the immune system attacking itself. Like most complex diseases have been investigated using the genome-wide association (GWAS) technology.<br><br>This strong point of this approach is that it has provided insight into how commonly found genetic variants affects diseases of everybody, i.e. as opposed to single-family-specific rare genetics variants. This means that most GWAS findings readily have been replicated between separate studies of different patients. <br><br>The weak point of GWAS, however, is that  findings typically only explain small fractions of the risk of each disease. This means that their actualy prognostic value still is somewhat limited. This is illstrated and explained here.<br><br>To run analysis input your user-id, or use the test-value of id_613z86871:<br><br>"),
