Impute.me is a non-profit genetics analysis site run by independent academics since August 2015. Our design goal is to provide analysis at the cutting edge of what is currently known and possible in genetics research. We try to provide this information in a manner that is as user-friendly as possible, but we are aware that it may be difficult to digest concepts such as <i>polygenic risk scores</i> and <i>imputation confidence</i>. Their difficulty level does not make them less crucial in genetic understanding. Few traits are governed by only a single gene or SNP.
<br>
<br>

A central part of the site is the creation of a guidebook for personal genome analysis (<u><a href='https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11070#t=suppl'>free preview</a></u>). This book provides more in-depth explanations for many of the concepts involved and we highly recommend it as a guide to accompany your analysis. Additionally, we refer to the open-source <u><a href='https://github.com/lassefolkersen/impute-me'>code repository</a></u>. Some aspects there may be fairly technical, but at least it provides a full, reproducible and auditable insight into how the genetics analysis is done. (<i>New: Updates to the site will be announced at <u><a href='https://twitter.com/ImputeMe'>twitter</a></u></i>). 
<br>
<br>
Finally, we welcome suggestions for other analysis types, particularly if you can program them yourself - the system is highly modular and can easily be extended even with just a limited knowledge of R-programming and genetics.<br>
