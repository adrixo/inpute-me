Most of the known drug-response-associated genetics concern liver enzymes (e.g. CYP2C19) and their break-down of drug metabolites. These are well characterized elsewhere already. The focus of this module is to integrate systematic multi-SNP profiles beyond liver enzymes and provide estimates of drug-response.<br><br>To illustrate how this works, the module shows the calculations that takes place for a number of drug response predictions, both on a per-drug level and on a per-SNP level, corresponding to the first and the second table. The first table summarizes per-drug calculation whenever possible. If possible, a <u><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score'>Z-score</a></u> is calculated in the same way as also described in the <u><a href='https://www.impute.me/AllDiseases/'>complex disease</a></u> module. If not, it is indicated as 'not calculated'. In that case it is necessary to look at the second table for comments on the individual SNPs from the input studies. The Z-score approach takes information from many SNPs, and can therefore be considered as more thourough, of course depending on the underlying scientific study.<br><br>"),
