This is done based on overall knowledge of human ethnicity and ancestry and is further explained in the video of this <u><a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1563061294/impute-my-genome'>kickstart project</a></u>. The first step in using this site is to upload your genetic data, and then wait for the analysis to run a few days. After that you'll receive an email with an ID-login that you can use to explore the remaining analysis pages.<br><br>
			 This service is free, but donations are very welcome since the server requirements for analysis are quite high. Also the service is completely anonymous and we will delete your genome two weeks after processing.<br><br><br>"),
