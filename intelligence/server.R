If you are looking for the IQ and EQ mesurements from previous version, de-select 'Only show newest study' under advanced options, and find <i>Emotional Intelligence [PMID 29527006]</i> (Warrier et al, EQ) and <i>Intelligence [PMID 29326435]</i> (Hill et al, IQ). However as <u><a href='https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/anthroscape/impute-me-ethnicity-plot-t80372-s30.html'>discussed</a></u>, we were not so happy with the Hill et al results and have updated to a more recent study. Also -- while under advanced options, do try out the new heritability plot options. We are working on accurate feedback on how much each score actually explains of a trait.</b><br><br><br>A polygenic risk score is a value that gives a summary of a large number of different SNPs - each of which contribute a little to disease risk. The higher the value, the higher the risk of developing disease. Of course the interpretation of this risk depends a lot on other factors as well: How heritable the disease is. How much of this heritability we can explain with known SNPs. And not least, what would the risk of disease be for you otherwise, i.e. without taking the genetic component into account. <br><br>Because the polygenic risk score is only a risk-modifier, knowledge of these three other values are all required if you want to know what your overall risk is, i.e. what's the chance in percent. This calculator cannot provide that. But it can provide a view of the <i>known genetic</i> component of your disease risk, based on all the SNPs that we know are associated with the disease. This, we believe, makes it a better choice for complex diseases than the typical one-SNP-at-the time analysis typically seen in consumer genetics.<br><br>"

Then a per-SNP score was calculated by counting the risk-alleles multiplied by the effect size (OR or beta as reported in original paper). This was centered so that the average score in the general population would be zero ('population normalized'). This means, that if a person is homozygote for a very rare risk variant this will result in a very high Z-score, conversely if the SNP is common, the Z-score will be less extreme. The sum of these normalized SNP-scores are calculated to get a trait-wide genetic risk score (GRS). This GRS was additionally scaled so that standard-deviation in the general population is 1 (unit-variance), effectively making the scores <u><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score'>Z-scores</a></u>. ", ethnicity_explanation_text, sd_calculation_sentence," Further details of the calculation can be found in the <u><a href='https://github.com/lassefolkersen/impute-me/blob/56813bf071d7fa4c0a658c90d2ebee196a781e8a/functions.R#L1166-L1326'>source code</a></u>. 
			          
		          <br><br>The advantage of this approach is that it does not require further data input than MAF, effect-size and genotype.  This makes the calculation fairly easy to implement. To perform a double check of this theoretical distribution, switch on the 'plot real distribution' option in the advanced options sections. In most cases the theoretical and real distribution is the same, but if it is not it may indicate problems such as highly-ethnicity specific effects. 
		          
		          <br><br>Another potential issue is that in some cases the term genetic <i>risk</i> score may be unclear. For example in the case of GWAS of biological quantities were it is not clear if higher values are <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> risk-related, e.g. HDL-cholesterol or vitamin-levels. Again it is recommended to consult with the original GWAS publication.
