Data was downloaded and filtered by proximity and P-values (according to slide-scale in advanced settings). Then a per-SNP score was calculated by counting the risk-alleles multiplied by the effect size (OR or beta as reported in original paper). This was centered so that the average score in the general population would be zero ('population normalized'). This means, that if a person is homozygote for a very rare risk variant this will result in a very high Z-score, conversely if the SNP is common, the Z-score will be less extreme. The sum of these normalized SNP-scores are calculated to get a trait-wide genetic risk score (GRS). This GRS was additionally scaled so that standard-deviation in the general population is 1 (unit-variance), effectively making the scores <u><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score'>Z-scores</a></u>.

                            <br><br>The advantage of this approach is that it does not require further data input than MAF, effect-size and genotype.  This makes the calculation fairly easy to implement. To perform a double check of this theoretical distribution, switch on the 'plot real distribution' option in the advanced options sections (Only implemented for GWAS calculator, not UK-biobank. yet).
                            
                      <br><br>Using UK-biobank compared to the GWAS calculator data has the advantage of being a highly systematic and (often) more well-powered approach. The trade-off is that less per-trait curation has been applied at the GWAS calculation step and that results are <i>not</i> peer-reviewed. The UK-biobank trait-note for this trait was: <i>",ukbiobank_notes,"</i>. Further, keep in mind that the UK-biobank consists of individuals of European ethnicity.
